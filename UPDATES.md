# Updates
<br>

### Update 0.1: Math

> The first commit. It just adds basic math operations. To use them, open the active interpreter and type any equaision you like<br>
```javascript
>> (5 + 5) * 2 + 4<br>
>> 24
```
<br>

### Update 0.2: Variables

> The first thing to resemble programming! Now you can make variables <br>
```javascript
>> var num = 10
```
<br>

> These can now be refered to inside math operations <br>

```javascript
>> num / 2
>> 5
```
> And they can also be referred to just by typing their identifier<br>

```javascript
>> var num2 = num + 5
>> num2
>> 15
```

> There are no mutations, constants or strings yet, but they'll be all added in future updates

### Update 0.21: Strings
> Just simple strings. When creating variables you can set the value as a string

```javascript
>> var name = 'HEHEHEHAW'
```

> You can also add numbers to it

```javascript
>> name + 2
>> HEHEHEHAW2
```

> But adding Strings themselves doesn't work yet

```javascript
>> name + 'hey'
ERROR
```

### Update 0.22: Anonymous Strings
> Now strings can stand by themselves
without any variables. So you can now add them to other anonymous strings or to variables

```javascript
>> var name = 'Hello,' + ' ' + 'world!'
>> name
>> Hello, world!

>> var name2 = 'Hello'
>> name2 + " world!"
>> Hello, world!
```

### Update  0.221: Big fixing + BEAUTIFUL md file

> This file now looks decent and strings work now. Before the string detection only worked sometimes. Now it SHOULD work every time (I hope)

```javascript
>> // before
>> var name1 = "Hello" + " world!"
>> name1
>> Hello" + " world!

>> // now
>> name1
>> Hello world!
```
